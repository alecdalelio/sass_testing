        I am a lifelong musician, songwriter and music producer and I am so
        excited to have the opportunity to share my experience with you! I am
        excited to work with you to learn the songs that YOU love, and learn how
        to develop your own style in the process.
      </p>

      <p class="main_paragraph2">
        I specialize in guitar improvisation, and I am well-versed in
        contemporary music (r&b, pop, hip-hop, alternative/indie, you name it),
        blues and rock. I have amassed over 500,000 YouTube views since I
        started posting videos of myself playing guitar at the age of 13. I
        write songs and produce my own original music, and I am lead guitarist
        for a local band called Will & the Foxhounds.
      </p>

      <p class="main_paragraph3">
        I will not teach you complex music theory, and I will not teach you to
        read classical sheet music. I WILL use simple chord sheets and tablature
        to teach you your favorite songs - you'll learn not only how to play
        these songs but also the underlying ideas and concepts that make them. I
        promise to give you the knowledge & technique to become a confident
        guitarist and lay the foundation for a lifetime of passionate
        musicianship!
